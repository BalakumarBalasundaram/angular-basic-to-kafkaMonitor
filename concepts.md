| Introduction / Basics        | Setting up the dev environment, and understanding why complexity arises in JavaScript apps.                 |
| Core Concepts (MVVM, DI, Digest Cycle) | Architectural patterns (MVVM), Dependency Injection (DI), the digest cycle for model synchronization, and performance optimizations. |
| Templates and Data Binding   | Data display, list rendering, conditional display, and custom filters for dynamic content presentation.      |
| Controllers and Services     | Cleaner controller usage and creation of reusable, injectable services using Factory and Provider patterns.  |
| Promises and HTTP            | Managing asynchronous operations and making HTTP requests to external APIs or servers.                      |
| Directives and Components    | Deep dive into building powerful custom behaviors (directives), linking DOM and logic, and moving toward simplified, component-based architecture. |
| Events and Modules           | Handling custom/DOM events and structuring large apps with modules.                                         |
| Routing and Navigation       | Implementing client-side routing: controllers with routes, preloading data, URL parameters, nested views, and tracking navigation events. |
| Forms and Validation         | Implementing and validating user input forms, both built-in and custom validations.                         |
| Testing                      | Testing different parts of AngularJS applications (JS code, Controllers, Services, Directives, Components) using Jasmine and test best practices. |
| Authentication Example       | Building a login service to manage authentication functionality.                                            |
